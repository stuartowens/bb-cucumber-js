{{<u>Attempts to abolish child labor began before the Civil War</u>}}. By 1863, seven states had passed laws limiting the hours of child workers to forty-eight a week, but {{<u>often the laws were not strictly enforced</u>}}. Most southern states refused to regulate child labor, and {{<u>children as young as six or seven years old continued to be widely employed in southern mills</u>}}. In the nation's mines, particularly in Appalachia, young boys were recruited to pick out the slate and waste from coal {{<u>as it passed along chutes</u>}}. Suspended on wooden boards over the moving coal, these "breaker boys" engaged in dangerous, physically demanding work. A boy who slipped into the coal had little chance of surviving without serious injury.
